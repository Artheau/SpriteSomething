# SpriteSomething

## Unit Tests

A battery of tests with the goal to ensure that any changes made will not hopefully pooch the entire project. These have a long way to go to test all of the things since we keep adding new toys to the interface.

Legacy = Tests implemented before refactor, but have not yet been updated to the new testing framework

Units = Tests of a specific class or module only
Integration = Tests of how classes/modules work together
System = Top level tests that simulate the user experience

Resources = Files needed to help determine if the tests work (e.g. test images)
