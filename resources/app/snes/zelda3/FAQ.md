## A Link to the Past FAQ

### How can I replace Link in A Link to the Past with a new character?

- File/Open. Choose any valid Link sprite sheet, e.g. `alice.zspr`.
  You can also import PNG files in this manner if they are formatted to have a palette block in the lower right corner.
- Export/Inject into Game File.

### The friendly thief in Lost Woods is a bit more of a pastel color than before. Why is this?

The injection tool also includes with it a patch that fixes some issues that occur when custom sprites have modified palettes. As part of this fix, the thief was moved to the closest available palette. We could have also changed him to be the same color of yellow that he is in the end credits... but where's the fun in that?

### Can I make my own sprite to replace Link?

Yes! This is one of the main focuses of the SpriteSomething project.

You can locate a list of Link sprites available at our [online SpriteSomething collection](http://artheau.github.io/SpriteSomething).
Documentation is still a little light, and so a key part of the project will be adding tutorials and documenting the available features.

You could, also, for instance, File/Open any Link to the Past ROM, and then File/Save a PNG file, which you could then modify and re-inject.
That said, this might not be the easiest way to start!

The Link to the Past spriting community is quite active, and there is a wealth of other resources that might be helpful to you.
A good place to start is the `#sprites` channel on the [ALttP Randomizer Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/alttprandomizer).
In the channel topic you will find a variety of tools and tutorials designed to assist you in this regard.
